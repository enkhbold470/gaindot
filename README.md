# GainDOT

GainDOT is a fitness app that allows fitness enthusiasts to earn NFTs and DOT tokens through physical activity, utilizing a unique network. The app combines workout motivation with blockchain technology, making fitness both fun and rewarding.

### What is GainDOT?

GainDOT is a decentralized app (dApp) that tracks your fitness activities and rewards you with NFTs and DOT tokens. It integrates with the Polkadot blockchain to ensure secure and transparent operations, providing an innovative way to incentivize fitness through blockchain technology.

### How to Use GainDOT

4. **Earn and Claim NFTs**:
   - The game is designed to be interactive and rewarding. For example, each pushup makes a Polkadot coin jump in the game, similar to Flappy Bird.
   - After completing a session, your score is combined with previous scores. You can then claim NFTs based on your points.
