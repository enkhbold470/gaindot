# GainDOT

GainDOT is a fitness app that allows fitness enthusiasts to earn NFTs and DOT tokens through physical activity, utilizing a unique network. The app combines workout motivation with blockchain technology, making fitness both fun and rewarding.

### What is GainDOT?

GainDOT is a decentralized app (dApp) that tracks your fitness activities and rewards you with NFTs and DOT tokens. It integrates with the Polkadot blockchain to ensure secure and transparent operations, providing an innovative way to incentivize fitness through blockchain technology.

### How to Use GainDOT

1. **Connect Your Wallet**:

   - First, connect your wallet to the GainDOT platform. Once connected, you'll see the wallet status on Polkadot.js, confirming the connection.

2. **Navigate the App**:

   - The main navigation bar includes options such as "Workout". Click on "Workout" to access various fitness activities and tips on how to use the app effectively.

3. **Participate in Fitness Games**:

   - One of the key features is the pushup fitness motivation game. In this game, you can compete with friends by counting your pushups. Each pushup is recorded by pressing the screen with your nose.
   - As you perform pushups, you collect points which are converted into rewards.

4. **Earn and Claim NFTs**:
   - The game is designed to be interactive and rewarding. For example, each pushup makes a Polkadot coin jump in the game, similar to Flappy Bird.
   - After completing a session, your score is combined with previous scores. You can then claim NFTs based on your points.
